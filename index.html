                <p>
		    Near the end of my tenure at UCLA, I took on the position of Team Lead for our UX/UI division. I met frequently with our product managers and developers in order to figure out reasonable goals for the design team to accomplish. I trained newer designers in Figma, managed our design system / UI kit, and assigned tasks to other members of the team. I also performed final edits to align different team members’ designs and ensure guidelines were met.

                <p>
		    While the production cycle began at Sports Excitement, I started working as a UX/UI designer for the company. Tasked with designing an online platform to help student athletes effectively plan their futures careers, I brainstormed features and functionalities of a mobile app that met our user’s needs. I became proficient at wireframing and asset creation in Figma in a short amount of time and contributed heavily to the team’s early design system.                 </p>

                    As an intern at Sports Excitement, I conducted UX and market research in student athlete professional development as well as aided in coordinating all aspects of the early-stage project. Goals in this role included designing and implementing an overall UX research strategy to study our primary round of participants, conducting competitor analysis through UX, CX, and market research, designing a pitchdeck to expand engagement with partners and investors, and managing weekly employee activity reports and records.

                <p>
                    In 2022 I worked at the Human Perception Lab, on campus at UCLA, where I assisted project scientists studying perceptual learning and adaptive education technology under Professor Philip Kellman. Main tasks included analyzing large datasets of study results, summarizing subject literature, and conceptualizing solutions to improve accuracy and precision of signal detection methods for measuring learner performance in discrimination tasks, along with administering these tasks to research participants.
